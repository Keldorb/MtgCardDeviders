MtGCardDividers

For anyone who doesn't want to pay much money for card deviders, here is a self printed alternative. 
I will try to update every Edition as soon as I can.
I've created this .pnd file with paint.net (https://www.getpaint.net/). Feel free to fork, report any issues or make requests.
To manage my collection I use Delver Lense (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=delverslab.delverlens&hl=de) and this sorting method.

Feel free to like and follow!

Patchnotes:
2021.04.01
- included sets till "Stryxhaven" and added more older sets.
2018.10.28
Fixed and adding additions from @Shaidar413 
- the grey (black) card was too high, pulled it down and did the same with the icons
- added a outline layer for those that do not want the whole color or print on colored paper did not mess with the small icons though.
- added a "flap" layer also for the small squares that stick up, so you can print the flaps in color and use outline for easy cutting.
Fixes and edits by me
- made card symbols optional (exept gold one) anyone got a good idear for the golden (multicolor Cards)? 
- fixed a Outline from @Shaidar413  in the white and gold space


Future Sights (hehe)
- adding seperate color deviders for ravnica
- adding two more deviders for ~~lands~~(done) and tokens
...more?!
